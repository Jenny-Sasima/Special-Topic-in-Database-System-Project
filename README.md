# Special-Topic-in-Database-System-Project
This repository is designated for the Special Topic in Database System Project, a course in my fourth year at Mahidol University. In this course, the professor has tasked us with cleaning and analyzing data using Alteryx for ETL processes to derive valuable insights. The insights data will then be utilized to develop a dashboard using the Power BI tool. The dataset used in this course is the Chicago Car Crash Dataset from Kaggle.
